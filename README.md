# Dynamic Exam Generator

This project involves the development of a dynamic exam generator and evaluator in C++. The application allows users to create an exam with multiple-choice questions, shuffle the questions and options randomly, and display the exam in a well-formatted HTML file. The project highlights core C++ features such as class construction, file handling, and the use of the Standard Template Library (STL) for efficient data manipulation.
